In order to run the main script “scriptFig16.m”, the external user must
copy both “scriptFig16.m” and “SCARLET_v1_GMDplotFig16.m” inside the folder 
“source_code”.
The plots of the pager are the result of five iterations in the for loop (N_repetitions = 5; @line 90). The external user can set it to 1 in order to have just one simulation and speed up the revision process.
