Figure 12 and Figure 13 require several simulations to be obtained.
In total there are 32 plots involved in these two figures. 
The attached script generates just one of the 32 figures. Th external user must
modify the input parameters within the script to generate all of them.
Especially for what concerns Fig.13 - more demanding - a cluster is needed for
the parallelisation to be effective.


In order to run the main script “scriptFig12_13.m”, the external user must
copy both “scriptFig12_13.m” and “SCARLET_v1_GMDplotFig12_13.m” inside the folder 
“source_code”.
Pay attention to the fact that the code searches for the stl file of the ellipsoid
in a dedicated folder (STL_examples/Fig12_Fig13). The path inside the script must be
correct in order to charge the right STL file.
